<Story><First_Name>Venkata Rathnam</First_Name><Last_Name>Muralidharan</Last_Name><About>I am a student pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Anna University.</About><Description> My first successful application was for an NGO called Delhi OYE for the role of Content Developer. I was shortlisted and asked to submit an assignment. I submitted a couple of write-ups on women empowerment, combating sexual harassment of women at public places, and the condition of women rights in India. They liked the assignments and a brief telephonic interview followed in which basic questions about my availability and future plans were asked. After a few days, I got the confirmation email that I was hired for the role. My happiness knew no bounds!&#13;
&#13;
I really enjoyed working with Delhi OYE during the internship. My work included writing on the topics of women empowerment, gender discrimination, etc. and marketing them through different channels. I also handled the digital marketing of the project Even Cargo initiated by them for the welfare of women.</Description></Story><Story><First_Name>dsfjklfj</First_Name><Last_Name>dskljf</Last_Name><About>sklsdjflskjdflkj</About><Description>dsdklfsdkljflasdkjflksjadfi </Description></Story></Stories>
